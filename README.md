Dokku Installer to Oracle Linux

# Why a installer to Oracle Linux?

Because Dokku does not suport Oracle Linux. So, I had to create a script to install it on Oracle Linux.

# What is does?

This scripts runs and install [Dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku) on an Oracle Linux server.

# How to use it

Simply run `install.sh` as `sudoer`

```
sudo bash install.sh
```
